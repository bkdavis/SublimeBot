SublimeBot
====================

Sublime Text plugin for executing custom automated tasks when view events are triggered.

Right now, I've just implemented triggers related to saving files (inspired by the CommandOnSave plugin) but intend to extend it to all view event listeners (http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.EventListener).
